We start in japan as a ninja (we could also add a shourikens) (also we need to make a good japan location). Then we go to siberia(nothing there just hardbass wind background)
Then maybe mongolia, but this may suck ass. China for sure, modified red sun in the sky will be our music. Then korea maybe. we definetely should make a boss like hard math or smth
